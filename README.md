### Considerations

  * I didn't want to touch the function that you kindly helped me to develope.

  * Found out that new Set could help me great deal yesterday

  * I DON'T know Jasmine. I need to dig deeper into it, I just made it enough to sort the problem that you sent me

  * I WILL during the weekend work a bit more the test unit
