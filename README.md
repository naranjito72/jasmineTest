### Considerations

  * I didn't want to touch the function that you kindly helped me to develop.

  * Found out that new Set could help me great deal yesterday

  * I DON'T know Jasmine. I need to dig deeper into it, I just made it enough to sort the problem that you sent me

  * I WILL during the weekend work a bit more the test unit

### Considerations II

Although I worked with objects as containers of data (key: value) and instances of Classes, wasn't until today that I realised that I could use them as containers of functions perse (key: value still)
as a standalone entity. Right now seems pretty obvious, but somehow I always split Objects as two different things. Both (N and D) pointed out to me about some facts in programming that, in my eager to
learn as fast as I could, I overstepped. Most definitely I need to read theory as much as I scan Stack Overflow answers.
